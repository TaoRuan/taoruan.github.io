- **Ph.D. in Computer Science**, University of Colorado Boulder, 2023  
- **Master‚Äôs in Information Technology**, Rutgers University, 2017  
- **Bachelor of Engineering in Automation**, University of Science and Technology of China, 2015  

### Work Experience
- **Research Assistant**, ASPIRE NSF Engineering Research Center  
- **Machine Learning Engineer Intern**, Suning R&D Center  
- **Data Analysis Intern**, Tilting Point  
- **Space Optimization Modeling Intern**, Philips Lighting Research  

### Key Projects
- **USGS RISK Dashboard**: Developed a social media monitoring tool for natural hazard detection using MongoDB, Spark, and Kibana.  
- **Crisis Informatics**: Conducted cross-platform social network analysis on **earthquake responses**, in collaboration with UC Berkeley and USGS.
